This util is for Windows.

The purpose of this is to copy the modified time of a file (say, a source file), to another file (say, a transcoded file)


This is useful when the transcoding tool you used doesn't support copying the modified time, or that you forgot to use that option.

(For Linux users who has access to Bash, checkout the "touch -r" command)
